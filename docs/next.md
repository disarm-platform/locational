# (Next) steps to take things forward

## Libraries to take a look at: 

* [ ]  `universe` (and its link to dc.js)
* [ ]  one of the transducer libraries (`transducers.js`/`transducer-js`/`transduce`/`transducist`)
* [ ]  `frappe` (backend not charts)
* [ ]  reductio for more advanced aggregations on `crossfilter`


## Do this

* [ ]  create some simple sample data - few tens of rows max
* [ ]  write text description of a few specific aggregations we've already done (e.g. 1 simple, 1 with denominator, 1 with a dependency)
* [ ]  write tests for each - not tied to any specific implementation
* [ ]  try a general codification of the description of each
* [ ]  pick one of the libraries above and describe the aggregation in their specific format (Runkit + ava?, or other approach with zero time on UI)
